Here is a break down of all of the details about my final 
project, based on the rubric given for the project

HTML Structure & Semantics: 
- Correct use of semantic HTML elements (<header>, <section>, <nav>, etc.)
    + Pretty much every page is broken up into 3 sections, being <header>, <section>, and <footer>
    + Inside of each of them I also used <div> for various things that all were within the same field
- Clean and accessible structure- Organized and readable HTML
    + Every page has the same structure, where starting at the top and going down you have the nav
      bar -> question for challege -> users answer -> submit button -> footer

CSS Styling & Layout:
- Consistent and creative styling
    + All most of the CSS is inside of the file styles.css, along with a few places in the html files with inline CSS
- Use of Flexbox or equivalent layout
    + Pretty much all of the segments of each page used a dark flex block with a blue outline
- Responsive design using media queries
    + The main one is the nav bar, where if you hover over the options the box changes color
 
JavaScript Functionality:
- Includes well-structured JS code using functions, arrays, conditionals, and loops
    + All of the JS files are located in the JS-files folder
    + Mainly the 3 challeges were writen mostly in these files
- Handles DOM manipulation effectively
    + For the math and riddle challege, everytime the user submitted their answer the page changes around using DOM manipulation
- Uses event listeners for interactivity
    + The main usage for event listeners was for any button that submitted forms
 
Form & Validation:
	- Includes at least one form
      + Pretty much all of the input fields for the challeges are inside of forms
  - Validates input with JavaScript
      + Inside of the forms in JS there are various checks
      + For example, for the riddles challege the input can't have numbers and must have 3 or more characters
  - Prevents default actions and gives clear feedback
      + Alerts pop up if something is wrong
